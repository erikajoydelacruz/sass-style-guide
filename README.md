# SASS Style Guide (Treehouse Techdegree)
 
I was given a mockup of a style guide made with plain CSS and was given the assignment to recreate it using SCSS. I sectioned the CSS into different partials, and recreated the style guide successfully. I learned a lot through this proejct, including ways to organize m partials and how to incorporate SASS into my future projects. This was also the quickest Techdegree project I've completed at about four hours.
